# A-CyTOF-Analysis-Pipeline-in-R
This is a reproduction of the CATALYST pipeline in Bioconductor, that is created for analyzing high dimensional CyTOF Data. This was created in an attempt make it more approachable to those who may be new to coding in R.

Here is a link to the paper, with full descriptions and introductions to CyTOF, and explaination of their datasets.

To begin: Make sure you fully read the paper in order to fully understand their data and experimental approach. This will help you understand why they use and generate different plots and how your own data may differ later. Download the metadata file and panel file, and make sure everything is in one folder in your computer.
